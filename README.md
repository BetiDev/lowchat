This app looks simple, but it's actually packed with tons of client and server features.
(Electron app will be a thing soon)

## Client Commands
### /users
Prints the user list

### /share
Prints a shareable URL for the current room

(I am planning to make this an NPM module with tons of options in order to make it more accessible)
